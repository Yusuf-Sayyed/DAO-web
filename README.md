Hello everyone, so this is how website will look https://unchcapital.com/

index.html is main page and join.html is second page which is attached to "Join Now" button.

I have used VS Code to Write code you can use any you want but VS code is recommended

You can copy repository in one click or you can add manually code in your files.

Thanks, Enjoy!
